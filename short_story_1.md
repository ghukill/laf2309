## Chapter 1

They leaned against a datapole, as a gentle mist was just leaving.  This moment could go one of two ways: the mist would be followed by a punishing barrage of acrid rain, or, the sun would come out and the young ones would rush outside.

You see, the young ones hadn't been outside in months.  For the youngest of them, where all time dialates to expand endlessly in both directions, this felt like their entire life.  

The rain that fell on this part of the world was much like the rain that fell on the rest of the world: painful, poison, and dangerous.

They pushed off from the datapole -- for a moment as perfect and precarious as a balanced egg -- and leaned forward into a slow shuffle.  What skin was exposed, just ears and face, has long become accustomed to the stinging rain.  They were headed, well, they didn't know.  They just needed to walk.

The rain burned the skin of humans like wine stains a tablecloth.  A single drop was all that's needed, and the effect was complete.  More wine would not deepen the coloration, just as more rain could not further the genetic mutations.  The moment was instant, perfect, and tragic.
